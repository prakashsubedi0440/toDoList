# toDoList

It is a simple todo-list application in which you can add and remove the daily to do list activities.
I have used node JS with express to create the app.

## To run the project
- download the zip files
- Enter to the directory where the file is downloaded
- install the node module dependencies in Hyper Terminal (HT) with "npm install"
- To run the app, in HT- node app.js
